# Soccer Robot

Soccer Robot is a robot (as the name suggests) is used to play soccer. It is controlled wirelessly using controller manually. It is powered
by 12V LiPo batteries. Power transmission is wireless.

### Electronics
Important electronics to understand the code - 

+ Arduino Mega 2560
+ L298N Motor Driver
+ PS2 Controller

### External Libraries
[PS2X Library](https://github.com/madsci1016/Arduino-PS2X)

To install, unzip and place 'PS2X_lib' folder into your 'C:\Users\{user name}\Documents\Arduino\libraries' folder
or '{Arduino IDE path}\hardware\libraries" or {Arduino IDE path}\libraries" directory.

Restart the Arduino IDE, and open up the example sketch.

### Controls

- Movement via **Left Joystick**
- Abdrupt brake by **R1**
- Gate movement by **Triangle** and **Cross**
- Slight directional turning by **R2** and **L2**

### Further Scope
This project can very well be made autonomous, using Infrared Sensing, or Computer Vision. This is an open-end. 
_Suggestions are welcome_.
